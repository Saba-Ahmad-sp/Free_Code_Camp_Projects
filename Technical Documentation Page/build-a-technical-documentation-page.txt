          Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language[a]
          for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It defines
          the content and structure of web content.
        </p>
        <p>
          HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML
          constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be
          embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create
          structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as
          headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other items. HTML
          elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets.
        </p>
        <code>some Html tags are: </code>
        <ul>
          <li>paragraph tag (p)</li>
          <li>heading tag (h1,h2...h6)</li>
          <li>image tag (img), etc</li>

          CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets, a computer language that
          controls how web pages look. It's used to style and structure HTML or
          XML documents, such as web pages.

        <code>What does CSS do? </code>
        <p>
          Changes the font, color, size, and spacing of content Adds animations
          and other decorative features Splits content into columns Describes
          how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on

          JavaScript (JS) is a programming language that allows developers to
          create interactive web pages. It's one of the core technologies of the
          World Wide Web.
        </p>
        <code>What can JavaScript do?</code>
        <p>
          Create interactive content JavaScript can add interactivity to web
          pages, such as animations, pop-up menus, and clickable buttons.
          Control multimedia JavaScript can control multimedia, such as video
          jukeboxes and webcam streams. Store and retrieve data JavaScript can
          store and retrieve data on a user's device, and send that data to a
          server for analytics or personalization. Build games JavaScript can be
          used to build games, especially when combined with HTML5 and an API
          like WebGL.

          Python is a high-level programming language that is used to develop
          websites, software, and data analysis tools. It is known for its
          readability and ease of use.
        </p>
        <code>What it's used for</code>
        <p>
          Web development: Python can be used to build websites Data analysis:
          Python can be used to analyze data and generate visualizations
          Software development: Python can be used to develop software Task
          automation: Python can be used to automate tasks Everyday tasks:
          Python can be used for everyday tasks like organizing finances

        <p>
          React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is a free and open-source
          front-end JavaScript library[5][6] that aims to make building user
          interfaces based on components more "seamless".[5] It is maintained by
          Meta (formerly Facebook) and a community of individual developers and
          companies
        </p>
        <p>
          React can be used to develop single-page, mobile, or server-rendered
          applications with frameworks like Next.js and Remix[a]. Because React
          is only concerned with the user interface and rendering components to
          the DOM, React applications often rely on libraries for routing and
          other client-side functionality.[11][12] A key advantage of React is
          that it only re-renders those parts of the page that have changed,
          avoiding unnecessary re-rendering of unchanged DOM elements.
        </p>
        <code>Key Features:</code>
        <pre>
<p>
Component-Based: React applications are built with components, which are small, reusable pieces of code that manage their own state and rendering.

Declarative: You describe what you want your UI to look like, and React takes care of updating it efficiently.

Virtual DOM: React uses a virtual representation of the DOM to optimize updates, making it performant even for complex applications.

JSX: JSX is a syntax extension that allows you to write HTML-like structures within your JavaScript code, making it easier to define UI components.
